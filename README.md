<h1>Welcome to VkFeedParser 3000!</h1>

  This is a small project, which in its final form should be able to authorize in *Vk*,
receive data about *posts* from the *Newsfeed* and write this data to different files in different threads.

During authorization, none of your personal login data is saved, only an unlimited token is saved for subsequent authorization.
<h6>All data stored personal data is stored locally in the config.json file.</h6>
